<h2>Grade 9 <a href='https://education.alberta.ca/media/3115252/2016_k_to_9_math_pos.pdf' target='_blank'>Math</a> with <a href='https://education.alberta.ca/media/3114953/ictpos.pdf' target='_blank'>ICT</a> Outcomes</h2>

### Statistics and Probability (Data Analysis)
General outcome: Collect, display and analyze data to solve problems.

Describe the effect of: • bias • use of language • ethics • cost • time and timing • privacy • cultural sensitivity on the collection of data. [C, CN, R, T] 

Select and defend the choice of using either a population or a sample of a population to answer a question. [C, CN, PS, R]

Develop and implement a project plan for the collection, display and analysis of data by: 
- formulating a question for investigation 
- choosing a data collection method that includes social considerations 
- selecting a population or a sample 
- collecting the data 
- displaying the collected data in an appropriate manner 
- drawing conclusions to answer the question. 
[C, PS, R, T, V]

<br>ICT C6–3.2 identify the appropriate materials and tools to use in order to accomplish a plan of action
<br>ICT C7–3.1 identify patterns in organized information
<br>ICT C7–3.2 make connections among related, organized data, and assemble various pieces into a unified message

### Statistics and Probability (Chance and Uncertainty)
Demonstrate an understanding of the role of probability in society. [C, CN, R, T]

### CTF Learning Outcomes 
CTF is exploring interests, passions and skills while making personal connections to career possibilities.
<br>CTF is planning, creating, appraising and communicating in response to challenges. 

CTF challenges or tasks that integrate at least two occupational areas (technology and human services), provides students with an opportunity to experience the interconnectedness of skills, knowledge and technologies associated with various occupational areas.
