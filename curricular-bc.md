### Big Ideas

Similar shapes have proportional relationships that can be described, measured, and compared.
- Geometry and Measurement: We can describe, measure, and compare spatial relationships. 

Analyzing the validity, reliability, and representation of data enables us to compare and interpret. 

### Curricular Competencies
Students are expected to do the following: 

Reasoning and analyzing 
- Use logic and patterns to solve puzzles and play games, including coding
- Use reasoning and logic to explore, analyze, and apply mathematical ideas 
- Use reasoning and logic to make connections, using inductive and deductive reasoning, predicting, generalizing, drawing conclusions through experiences
- Estimate reasonably by using referents, approximation, and rounding strategies (e.g., the distance to the stop sign is approximately 1 km the width of my finger is about 1 cm)
- Use tools or technology to explore and create patterns and relationships, and test conjectures • Model mathematics in contextualized experiences 

Understanding and solving 
- Apply multiple strategies to solve problems in both abstract and contextualized situations 
- Develop, demonstrate, and apply mathematical understanding through play, inquiry, and problem solving 
- Visualize to explore mathematical concepts 

Communicating and representing 
- Use mathematical vocabulary and language to contribute to mathematical discussions 
- Explain and justify mathematical ideas and decisions 
- Communicate mathematical thinking in many ways 
- Represent mathematical ideas in concrete, pictorial, and symbolic forms,  and by using spoken or written language to express, describe, explain, justify, and apply mathematical ideas; may use technology such as screencasting apps, digital photos 

Connecting and reflecting 
• Reflect on mathematical thinking 
• Connect mathematical concepts to each other and to other areas and personal interests 
• Use mathematical arguments to support personal choices

Content
Students are expected to know the following:
- spatial proportional reasoning 
- statistics in society

proportional relationships: 
- Geometry and Measurement: We can describe, measure, and compare spatial relationships. 
- Proportional reasoning enables us to make sense of multiplicative relationships.  

data: 
- Data and Probability: Analyzing data and chance enables us to compare and interpret. 
Statistics:
- population versus sample, bias, ethics, sampling techniques, misleading stats 
- analyzing a given set of data (and/or its representation) and identifying potential problems related to bias, use of language, ethics, cost, time and timing, privacy, or cultural sensitivity

### Big Ideas
Daily participation in different types of physical activity influences our physical literacy and personal health and fitness goals.
Lifelong participation in physical activity has many benefits and is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle.

### Curricular Competencies
Students are expected to be able to do the following: 

Physical literacy 
- Develop, refine, and apply fundamental movement skills in a variety of physical activities and environments 
- Develop and apply a variety of movement concepts and strategies in different physical activities 
— What strategies can you use to gain some type of advantage in a game situation?
- Apply methods of monitoring and adjusting exertion levels in physical activity 
— Example of monitoring and adjusting physical exertion levels: rate of perceived exertion scales to self-assess exertion levels and make appropriate adjustments related to the activity
- Develop and demonstrate safety, fair play, and leadership in physical activities 

Content
Students are expected to know the following: 

- proper technique for fundamental movement skills including non-locomotor, locomotor, and manipulative skills 
- movement concepts:
body awareness (e.g., parts of the body, weight transfer), 
spatial awareness (e.g., general spacing, directions, pathways), 
effort awareness (e.g., speed, force), 
relationships to/with others and objects,
- strategies: plans and/or ideas that will help a player or team successfully achieve a movement outcome or goal (e.g., moving into space away from an opponent to receive a pass) 
ways to monitor and adjust physical exertion levels

Information and Communications Technologies 
Students are expected to know the following:

### Research and Information Literacy

Students apply digital tools to gather, evaluate, and use information.
A digitally literate person uses technology to improve his/her ability to gather, organise, analyse and judge the relevance and purpose of digital information.
The student:
- Understands and interprets data, and reports results.
- Judges the validity of content found on the Internet, how to find appropriate material, and what sources can be trusted.
- Compares, contrasts, and synthesizes information from diverse sources (triangulates information) before it is used in a knowledge-making process.

Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Decision Making
Students use critical thinking skills to plan and conduct research, manage projects, solve problems, and make informed decisions using appropriate digital tools and resources.
Specialized and Advanced Skills for Learning
A digitally literate person uses ICT to improve his/her learning performance.
	The student:
- Collects and analyzes data to identify solutions and/or make informed decisions.
- Uses digital technology to identify and define authentic problems and significant questions for investigation. 
- Creates knowledge representations using digital media.
- Creates complex models and simulations of the real world using digital information.
- Can program ranging from using block building code tools to a high-level programming language.

Creativity and Innovation
Students demonstrate creative thinking, construct knowledge, and develop innovative products and processes using technology.
	The student:
- Uses digital models and simulations to explore complex systems and issues.
- Uses digital technology to identify trends and forecast possibilities.
- Remixes different existing digital content into something new.

Digital Citizenship
Students understand human, cultural, and societal issues related to technology and practice legal and ethical behavior.
Balanced Attitude towards Technology
A digitally literate person demonstrates an informed, open-minded, and balanced attitude towards information society and the use of digital technology, is curious, aware of opportunities and new developments, and is comfortable to explore and exploit them.
The student:
- Understands that the digital environment can make things better or worse depending on how we use it.
- Exhibits a positive attitude toward using technology that supports collaboration, learning, and productivity.
- Has a positive, but realistic attitude towards the benefits and risks associated with information technologies.

Technology Operations and Concepts
Students demonstrate a sound understanding of technology concepts, systems, and operations, and develop computational thinking skills

General Knowledge and Functional Skills
A digitally literate person knows the basics (terminology, navigation, functionality) of digital devices and can use them for basic purposes.
The student:
- Understands that computer programming algorithms are sets of instructions that tell computers what to do.
- Can design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals, such as controlling or simulating physical systems.
- Can solve programmatic problems by decomposing them into smaller parts.
