### Social-Emotional Learning Skills in Mathematics and the Mathematical Processes

As they apply the mathematical processes:
- problem solving: develop, select, and apply problem-solving strategies
- reasoning and proving: develop and apply reasoning skills to justify thinking, make and investigate conjectures, and construct and defend arguments
- reflecting: demonstrate that as they solve problems, they are pausing, looking back, and monitoring their thinking to help clarify their understanding connecting: make connections among mathematical concepts, procedures, and representations, and relate mathematical ideas to other contexts (e.g., other curriculum areas, daily life, sports)
- communicating: express and understand mathematical thinking, and engage in mathematical arguments using everyday language, language resources as necessary, appropriate mathematical terminology, a variety of representations, and mathematical conventions
- representing: select from and create a variety of representations of mathematical ideas, and apply them to solve problems
- selecting tools and strategies: select and use a variety of concrete, visual, and electronic learning tools and appropriate strategies to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems

### Coding Skills

C3.1 solve problems and create computational representations of mathematical situations by writing and executing code, including code that involves the analysis of data in order to inform and communicate decisions
- Data can be stored in lists, or input into a program, in order to find solutions to problems and make decisions.
- Efficient code can include using the fewest number of instructions to solve a problem, using the smallest amount of space to store program data, or executing as fast as possible.
- Loops can be used to create efficient code.
- Conditional statements, like loops, can be nested to allow for a range of possible outcomes or to implement decision trees.
- Sub-programs are used to assemble a complex program by writing portions of the code that can be modularized. This helps to create efficient code.
- By combining mathematical and coding concepts and skills, students can write programs to draw conclusions from data.
- Students can use data, coding, and math concepts and skills to generate a range of possibilities and likelihoods and decide upon a specific course of action (e.g., optimizing packaging, price points, sports performance).
- Coding can be used to automate simple processes and enhance mathematical thinking. For example, students can code expressions to recall previously stored information (defined variables), then input values (e.g., from a sensor, count, or user input) and redefine the value of the variable. 

C3.2 read and alter existing code involving the analysis of data in order to inform and communicate decisions, and describe how changes to the code affect the outcomes and the efficiency of the code
- Reading code is done to make predictions as to what the expected outcome will be. Based on that prediction, one can determine if the code needs to be altered prior to its execution.
- Reading code helps with troubleshooting why a program is not able to execute.
- Code is altered so that an expected outcome can be achieved.
- Code can be altered to be used for a new situation.
- Altering code to make it more efficient often involves refining algorithms so that there are no unnecessary steps and using control structures effectively.
- Using sub-programs makes it easier to debug programs since each sub-program can be tested individually.
- Altering existing code and describing how changes affect outcomes allows students to investigate relationships and pose and test what-if questions.
- By describing how changes affect outcomes, students are making predictions.
- By reading and describing code and algorithms, students are learning to articulate complex mathematical ideas and concepts.
- When students are provided with code and algorithms to solve complex problems, they can alter this code to solve similar problems, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the mathematical and coding concepts involved.

### C4 Mathematical Modelling

Overall expectation
<br>By the end of Grade 8, students will apply the process of mathematical modelling to represent, analyse, make predictions, and provide insight into real-life situations.

This overall expectation has no specific expectations. Mathematical modelling is an iterative and interconnected process that is applied to various contexts, allowing students to bring in learning from other strands. Students’ demonstration of the process of mathematical modelling, as they apply concepts and skills learned in other strands, is assessed and evaluated.
The process of mathematical modelling requires: understanding the problem; analysing the situation; creating a mathematical model; and analysing and assessing the model.

*Note*
A mathematical modelling task is different from a real-life application due to the cyclic nature of modelling, which involves examining a problem from outside mathematics, modelling it, and then checking the model back against the real-life situation and adjusting as necessary.

### Data Collection and Organization

D1.1 identify situations involving one-variable data and situations involving two-variable data, and explain when each type of data is needed
- A variable is any attribute, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted.
- One-variable data refers to one data set from a sample or a population that can be either qualitative or quantitative. Two-variable data refers to two data sets from the same sample or population that can be either qualitative or quantitative. 

D1.2 collect continuous data to answer questions of interest involving two variables, and organize the data sets as appropriate in a table of values
- The type and amount of data to be collected is based on the questions of interest. Questions of interest involving two variables require two sets of data to be collected from the same sample or population.
- Depending on the question of interest, the continuous data may need to be collected from a primary or a secondary source.
- A table of values for a scatter plot is a list of corresponding values of two variables for each subject in a sample or population. 
- A scatter plot does not guarantee that there is a relationship between the two variables. Therefore, it is only when there is a relationship that one variable is dependent on the other variable (i.e., for a relation, the x-value in the set of ordered pairs (x, y) is the independent variable and the y-value is the dependent variable).

### Data Visualization

D1.3 select from among a variety of graphs, including scatter plots, the type of graph best suited to represent various sets of data; display the data in the graphs with proper sources, titles, and labels, and appropriate scales; and justify their choice of graphs
- Scatter plots are used to display data points for two continuous variables. The horizontal axis identifies the possible values for one variable and the vertical axis identifies the possible values for the other variable.
- Broken-line graphs are used to show change over time. The value on the horizontal axis is usually time. One or none of the variables are continuous.
- Circle graphs are used to show how categories represent a part of the whole data set for one variable. 
- Histograms display data as intervals of numeric data, and their frequencies for one variable that is continuous.
- Pictographs, line plots, bar graphs, multiple-bar graphs, and stacked-bar graphs may be used to display qualitative data and discrete data, and their corresponding frequencies for one variable.
- Data that is represented in a table of values displays two pieces of information for each subject in the sample or population. These two pieces of information can be graphed together using a scatter plot. Also, each piece of information can be treated separately and represented using another type of graph such as a histogram or circle graph.

D1.4 create an infographic about a data set, representing the data in appropriate ways, including in tables and scatter plots, and incorporating any other relevant information that helps to tell a story about the data
- Infographics are used in real life to share data and information on a topic, in a concise, clear, and appealing way.
- Infographics contain different representations, such as tables, plots, graphs, with limited text such as quotes.
- Information to be included in an infographic needs to be carefully considered and presented so that it is clear and concise. Infographics tell a story about the data with a specific audience in mind. When creating infographics, students need to create a narrative about the data for that audience.

### Data Analysis

D1.5 use mathematical language, including the terms “strong”, “weak”, “none”, “positive”, and “negative”, to describe the relationship between two variables for various data sets with and without outliers
- When data points form close to a line or a curve, this indicates there is a strong relationship between the variables.
- When data points are in a cluster, this indicates there is no relationship.
- The scatter plot of a weak relationship between two variables shows points that are more spread out than those showing a strong relationship.
- The scatter plot of a positive relationship shows points going upwards from the origin and to the right. The scatter plot of a negative relationship shows points going down from the y-axis to the x-axis.
- A line of best fit or a curve of best fit can be drawn through the majority of the points and used to make predictions where there is a strong relationship between the two variables.

D1.6 analyse different sets of data presented in various ways, including in scatter plots and in misleading graphs, by asking and answering questions about the data, challenging preconceived notions, and drawing conclusions, then make convincing arguments and informed decisions
- Scatterplots are used to determine if a relationship exists between two numerical variables. Analysis of the scatter plot requires identifying how closely the points form a line or curve in order to conclude that there is a relationship.
- The range and the measures of central tendencies may be used to analyse data involving one variable.
- Sometimes graphs misrepresent data or show it inappropriately and this could influence the conclusions that we make about it. Therefore, it is important to always interpret presented data with a critical eye.
- Data presented in tables, plots, and graphs can be used to ask and answer questions, draw conclusions, and make convincing arguments and informed decisions.
- Sometimes presented data challenges current thinking and leads to new and different conclusions and decisions.
- Questions of interest are intended to be answered through the analysis of the representations. Sometimes the analysis raises more questions that require further collection, representation, and analysis of data.

There are three levels of graph comprehension that students should learn about and practise:
<br>Level 1: information is read directly from the graph and no interpretation is required.
<br>Level 2: information is read and used to compare (e.g., greatest, least) or perform operations (e.g., addition, subtraction).
<br>Level 3: information is read and used to make inferences about the data using background knowledge of the topic.

### Probability

D2.1 solve various problems that involve probability, using appropriate tools and strategies, including Venn and tree diagrams

D2.2 determine and compare the theoretical and experimental probabilities of multiple independent events happening and of multiple dependent events happening

### Geometric Reasoning

E1.3 use scale drawings to calculate actual lengths and areas, and reproduce scale drawings at different ratios
Grids are helpful for making scaled drawings.

### Strand A - Social-Emotional Learning Skills

Identification and Management of Emotions
<br>A1.1 apply skills that help them identify and manage emotions as they participate in learning experiences in health and physical education, in order to improve their ability to express their own feelings and understand and respond to the feelings of others

<br>A1.3 apply skills that help them develop habits of mind that support positive motivation and perseverance as they participate in learning experiences in health and physical education, in order to promote a sense of optimism and hope 

Healthy Relationships
<br>A1.4 apply skills that help them build relationships, develop empathy, and communicate with others as they participate in learning experiences in health and physical education, in order to support healthy relationships, a sense of belonging, and respect for diversity

Self-Awareness and Sense of Identity
<br>A1.5 apply skills that help them develop self-awareness and self-confidence as they participate in learning experiences in health and physical education, in order to support the development of a sense of identity and a sense of belonging

Critical and Creative Thinking
<br>A1.6 apply skills that help them think critically and creatively as they participate in learning experiences in health and physical education, in order to support making connections, analysing, evaluating, problem solving, and decision making

*Critical and creative thinking skills and processes are involved in choosing or devising tactical solutions at any age. However, the focus of social-emotional learning skill development shifts with the student’s stage of development, and this shift may be evident in the context of applying tactical solutions. Students in Grades 1–3 may be focusing on identifying and managing emotions and learning about themselves; students in Grades 4–6 may be ready to strengthen skills for interacting with others, persevering, and coping with challenges; and students in Grades 7 and 8 may be prepared to focus on deepening thinking skills and their understanding of themselves and others (e.g., working as a team to choose tactics that will result in the greatest success, adjusting play in response to an opponent’s actions or conditions in the environment).*
